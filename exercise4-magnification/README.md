# Magnification/Zoom Testing

So far in this workshop, we've only looked at the desktop width.

In the industry at this point in time, it's rare to build a website that doesn't get visited on mobile.

And no matter the device, if a visitor to our website is low vision, they might zoom in.

Our web applications should remain usable no matter the zoom level or viewport size.

The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines have something to say about this, too:
