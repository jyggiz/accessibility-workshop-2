    Building accessible websites and applications with HTML, CSS and JavaScript
  </h2>
  <p>
    Ensuring your frontend code is accessible requires consistent development effort and testing of inclusive markup and scripted interactions. In this workshop we’ll test a
    website using widely supported and proven tools and techniques. There are intentional
    accessibility issues on this site: prepare yourself to find things to fix!
  </p>
</div>

## Prerequisites

- This workshop on Manual Testing & Tools is intended for web developers of all skill and experience levels. Some knowledge of the Web Platform will be helpful (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript).
- In later workshops, the development exercises will become increasingly more advanced. Experience with JavaScript, React, and Git will be necessary.

## Options for working with this material

- [Browser-based setup with GitPod](https://gitpod.io/from-referrer/)
  - GitPod provides a cloud-based development environment similar to VS Code
  - Requires a login with Github
  - **Note**: GitPod may have accessibility issues
- Download a zip file for local setup
- Clone this Git repo for local setup (see instructions below)

## System Requirements for Local Setup

- [git][git] v2.13 or greater
- [NodeJS][node] `12 || 14 || 15 || 16`
- [yarn][yarn] v1

All of these must be available in your `PATH`. To verify things are set up
properly, you can run this:

```shell
git --version
node --version
yarn --version
```

If you have trouble with any of these, learn more about the PATH environment
variable and how to fix it here for [windows][win-path] or
[mac/linux][mac-path].

## Setup

> If you want to commit and push your work as you go, you’ll want to
> [fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo)
> first and then clone your fork rather than this repo directly.
> Be sure to fetch the latest code on the day of the workshop by [syncing your fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/syncing-a-fork).

After you’ve made sure to have the pre-requisites installed, you
should be able to run a few commands to get set up:

```
git clone https://github.com/jyggiz/accessibility-workshop-2.git
cd accessibility-workshop-2
yarn
```

There may be periodic changes to this repo. To update your local build, run:

```
git pull
```

Note: if you have local changes, you'll need to commit them to a branch. Here's
some extra help on using Git: [https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/git-pull-explained/]

## Running the project locally

This repo contains various workshop files and a static website. To get the site up and running (and really see if it worked) with [Parcel](https://parceljs.org), run this command from the project’s root folder:

```shell
yarn start
```

This should start the site for your browser at the address indicated in your Terminal:
`http://localhost:1234`

## Working through the exercises

This part of the project has **before** and **after** files for each of the 5 sections. The two pages we’ll work on in this Workshop are the Homepage and About page, starting from this URL: `http://localhost:1234`

Here are the example source files for this workshop:

- [exercise1-keyboard](https://github.com/jyggiz/accessibility-workshop-2/tree/master/exercise1-keyboard)
- [exercise2-devtools](https://github.com/jyggiz/accessibility-workshop-2/tree/master/exercise2-devtools/)
- [exercise3-extensions](https://github.com/jyggiz/accessibility-workshop-2/tree/master/exercise3-extensions/)
- [exercise4-magnification](https://github.com/jyggiz/accessibility-workshop-2/tree/master/exercise4-keyboard/)
- [exercise5-screenreader](https://github.com/jyggiz/accessibility-workshop-2/tree/master/exercise5-screenreader/)

This structure will allow you to iterate on working files with separate directories for the example sections.

The purpose of an exercise is **not** for you to work through all the material.
It’s intended to get your brain thinking about the right questions to ask as
we go through the material together.

Contributions of any kind are welcome!
