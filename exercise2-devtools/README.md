# Developer Tools Testing

Browsers these days provide incredible built-in tools for developers. In this section, weâ€™ll use
Chrome, Firefox, and Safari's devtools to improve color contrast and semantics of our markup.

Things to uncover with devtools:

- Color Contrast
- Image text alternatives
- Semantics in lists, other markup

## Exercise: Fix contrast of megamenu, miscellaneous semantics

Using the files in this directory as a reference, improve keyboard access on these pages:

- `index.html`

URL to view "fixed" files locally:

http://localhost:1234/exercise2-devtools

URL to view a deployed version for this exercise:

https://workshop-manual-a11y-testing.testingaccessibility.com/exercise2-devtools

Files you'll touch to make these improvements include:

- Color contrast: `scss/_header.scss`
- Image alt text: `_includes/header.html`
- Image alt text and semantic markup: `index.html`
- Styling of lists and other markup:
  - `scss/pages/_home.scss`
  - `scss/_layouts.scss`
  - `scss/pages/_about.scss`

You'll also find colors available to choose from in the main variables CSS file:

- `scss/_variables.scss`
